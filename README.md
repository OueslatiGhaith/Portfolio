# Portfolio
a website containing a portfolio


This is a website created a project for the "Internet Techniques and Languages 1" course.
In this course, students are asked to pick a subject and make a website about it, using HTML, CSS and JS.

The topic I chose for this project is "Portfolio", a website containing information about myself and my career so far.
